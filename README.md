# _Brucella_ type strain work
This is a repository for summary data, scripts, and workflows to evaluate all species type strains in the bacterial genus _Brucella_.

## Background on _Brucella_
### Taxonomy
- The first formal description of the genus _Brucella_ was in **1920** by the British microbiologist **David Bruce**, who had previously identified _Micrococcus melitensis_ (now _Brucella melitensis_) in 1887 from the spleen of a soldier who died of "Malta fever."
- The genus name _Brucella_ honors **Sir David Bruce**.  
- **6** classical species exist which were all described prior to 1970:  _B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, B. canis, B. ovis, B. neotomae_.
- In the 2000s and 2010s, additional _Brucella_ species were isolated from wildlife and marine mammals:  _B. ceti, B. pinnipedialis, B. microti, B. inopinata_, _B. papionis_, _B. vulpis_.
- In 2020, 18 species of the _Ochrobactrum_ genus were merged into the _Brucella_ genus.

### Genomics
- The first complete genome sequences of _Brucella_ were published in **2002** (_B. melitensis_ 16M and _B. suis_ 1330) by the TIGR and DOE Joint Genome Institute consortia ([NCBI example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000007125.1/)).  
- _Brucella_ genomes are typically **~3.2-3.4 Mbp** in size, with a high **GC content (~57%)**, organized into **2 circular chromosomes**.
- Most publicly available raw sequence data now have corresponding genome assemblies in [NCBI Taxonomy Browser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=234&lvl=3).  
- Assembly sizes from Illumina-only sequencing usually range from 3.1 to 3.4 Mbp across **20-25 contigs**.

## Data stored here
- [XLSX file](https://github.com/bacterial-genomics/brucella_type_strains/raw/refs/heads/main/type-strain-info/List%20of%20approved%20Brucella%20species.xlsx) listing of species type strains with several features for each:
  - effective publication year
  - 16S rRNA gene sequence accession
  - RefSeq genome accession
  - taxonomic status
  - host association (domestic livestock, wildlife, marine mammals, rodents, etc.)
